Cross Correlation Compilation Programme

Files and what they do
-----------------------

cccp.m - Main control file - order of suggested operation script.

general_settings.m - Control settings for the program. These will be drop in interchangable with a GUI.

template_data_input.m - Current input file with station and arrival time information

CC_SingleChannel_Java.m - Works in conjunction with irisFetch.m to capture single day waveforms and match them against a given template

convertTraces.m - Converts the struct data given by irisFetch.m into a waveform object.
convertTracesRM_IR.m - Same as above, but also removes instrument response.

CC_SingleStation_Stack.m - Stacks three components of cross correlations for a particular station.

CC_Scan_Stack.m - Reviews the stacked cross correlations from one station for template matches.

generateCorrelationObject.m - Takes results generated by scan function and picks out waveform snippets for further review.


Things that need work
---------------------

-The whole template determination process needs to be clearer.
- As of now, it requires the user to input data about the station and the event with regard to the station.

- Template matches need to be better scrutinized for duplicates
- Station stacking needs to be enhanced to 12+ components (multiple stations)
